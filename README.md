Hi :3

I'm a self-taught coder. I started by watching Roblox scripting tutorials, and later got into JavaScript.

YAUTC was the first project where I used ChatGPT to help me code, and it’s actually the reason I even wanted to learn JavaScript. At first, I used ChatGPT for pretty much everything, but over time I started figuring things out on my own.

If I hadn’t built YAUTC and figured out a good way to handle zero-width emotes while coding it, I probably wouldn’t have made YAUTO. The reason I started YAUTO is because ChatIS (one of the most popular chat overlays) had a bad zero-width emote display, and I wanted to fix that.

Right now, I’m mainly focused on [YAUTO](https://github.com/Fiszh/YAUTO), a Twitch chat overlay for OBS and other streaming tools.

Not too long ago, I also launched my website: [unii.dev](https://unii.dev/)
