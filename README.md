Hi :3

I’m a self-taught coder.
I started with Roblox scripting tutorials and later got into JavaScript.
The first time I touched JavaScript, it was just running console commands from YouTube tutorials.

My real journey with JavaScript began when I started **YAUTC**.
At first, everything was done with ChatGPT’s help, but over time I started learning and doing things on my own.

If I hadn’t started YAUTC, apps like **UChat** (formerly YAUTO) wouldn’t exist.
I decided to make UChat after discovering a way to handle zero-width emotes while trying to implement them in YAUTC.

Right now, I’m mainly focused on [UChat](https://github.com/Fiszh/UChat), a Twitch chat overlay.

The first versions of UChat were hosted on a GitHub static website, which was pretty limiting.
Now, with [unii.dev](https://unii.dev/), there are way fewer limits, and I can push much better updates.
