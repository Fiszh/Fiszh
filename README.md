Hi :3

I'm a self-taught coder. I started by watching Roblox scripting tutorials, and later got into JavaScript. I learned most of it by building stuff and using ChatGPT to help along the way.

One of my first projects was [YAUTC](https://github.com/Fiszh/YAUTC), and right now I'm mainly working on [YAUTO](https://github.com/Fiszh/YAUTO). It's a Twitch chat overlay that works with OBS and other streaming tools.

Not too long ago, I also launched my website: [unii.dev](https://unii.dev/)
